# Practical 
1. So far until the 2 weeks watched the lecture videos.
2. I watch videos mostly weekend evening time.
3. Now I do "Do this now" while watching the lecture videos and actively doing the practice question immediately.
4. I need to stop the last minute submission and last minute preparation.
5. Using functions sometimes i struggle so, I need to practice.
6. I think i do everything before i go for the class somewhat i finish early.
